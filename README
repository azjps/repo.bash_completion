Bash completion for repo utility (http://code.google.com/p/git-repo/),
backported for bash version 3.x.

License: public domain.

Known bugs:

1. Due to bash completion peculiarities completion inside an input line does not
work as expected. E.g.:
  repo upload --br= --reviewers=reviewer@somewhere.com project
  cursor --------> ^
In this case branch won't be completed before you enter any letter. This bug
can be worked around but this requires reimplementing of bash completion library
word splitting routines which I'm reluctant to do right now.
